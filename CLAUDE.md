## Project Overview

This is a Pebble smartwatch application written in C using the Pebble SDK.

## Supported Platforms

The app targets multiple Pebble watch models:
- aplite (Pebble classic)
- basalt (Pebble Time)
- chalk (Pebble Time Round)
- diorite (Pebble 2)
- emery (Pebble Time 2)

## Commands

```bash
# Build the app for all platforms
pebble build

# Clean build artifacts
pebble clean

# Install the app on specific emulator
pebble install --emulator basalt

# Screenshot the running emulator
pebble screenshot --no-open screenshot.png
```

If you need more information on the `pebble` command or a sub-command, append `--help`.

## Project Structure

```
src/c/           - C source files for the watchapp
src/pkjs/        - PebbleKitJS files (currently empty)
worker_src/c/    - Worker source files (optional, not present)
resources/       - Images, fonts, and other resources (not present)
```
## Configuration

By default, this project is initialized as a watchface. To make it an app, replace "watchface": true with "watchface": false in package.json.

## Architecture

The application follows the standard Pebble app architecture:

1. **Main Entry Point**: `src/c` - The `main()` function initializes the app and starts the event loop
2. **Window Management**: Single window app with text layer for displaying button press feedback
3. **Event Handling**: Button click handlers registered via `prv_click_config_provider` for UP, DOWN, and SELECT buttons

## Development Best Practices

- Whenever making changes, run `pebble screenshot` and view the screenshot to make sure it's what the user requested. If not, make more changes until it does what it's supposed to.

## AI Interaction Guidelines

- When given an image of a watchface to replicate, describe the target watchface in precise detail. Note every visual element present, as well as size, alignment, font weight, spacing, and location.

## AI Code Review Guidelines

- Once you think you've fulfilled the user's request, ask yourself if you see any issues with the current screenshot, and if there are any differences between the screenshot and the reference image or the user's description. If so, fix them.
